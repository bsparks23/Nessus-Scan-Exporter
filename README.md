Nessus Scan Exporter is a Python script that uses the Nessus API to find the latest scan by parsing the json response and using a lambda function to look for the latest creation date. The latest scan is exported to an HTML file by using a token that is generated from the API. The script doesn't use third party Nessus libraries and interacts with the Nessus API directly. The script is designed to use a signed certificate for HTTPS so information that is sent to the Nessus server is encrypted. A self-signed certificate can be generated with OpenSSL by using a 2048 bit or 4096 bit RSA key pair if it's being used over the localhost. By default, the included Nessus certificate doesn't allow SSL/HTTPS. A signed certificate from a CA may also be used.
